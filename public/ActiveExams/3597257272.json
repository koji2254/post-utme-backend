Ocean acidification can impair the growth and survival of these organisms, disrupting marine food webs and ecosystems.\n\nThe melting of polar ice caps and glaciers is another consequence of climate change, contributing to rising sea levels. This poses a threat to coastal habitats and human settlements, leading to increased erosion, flooding, and loss of biodiversity. Furthermore, changes in ocean currents and temperatures can alter the distribution and behavior of marine species, leading to shifts in marine biodiversity and the potential collapse of fisheries.\n\nEfforts to mitigate the impact of climate change on marine ecosystems include reducing greenhouse gas emissions, protecting and restoring marine habitats, and promoting sustainable fishing practices.
