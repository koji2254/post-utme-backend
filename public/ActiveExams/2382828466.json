                    "comprehension": "Climate change is having a profound impact on marine ecosystems around the globe. Rising ocean temperatures are causing widespread coral bleaching, a phenomenon where corals expel the symbiotic algae living in their tissues, leading to a loss of color and, eventually, the death of the coral. This not only affects the corals themselves but also the vast array of marine life that depends on coral reefs for food and shelter.\n\nAdditionally, the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide is leading to ocean acidification. This process reduces the availability of carbonate ions, which are crucial for the formation of calcium carbonate structures in marine organisms such as shellfish and certain types of plankton. Ocean acidification can impair the growth and survival of these organisms, disrupting marine food webs and ecosystems.\n\nThe melting of polar ice caps and glaciers is another consequence of climate change, contributing to rising sea levels. This poses a threat to coastal habitats and human settlements, leading to increased erosion, flooding, and loss of biodiversity. Furthermore, changes in ocean currents and temperatures can alter the distribution and behavior of marine species, leading to shifts in marine biodiversity and the potential collapse of fisheries.\n\nEfforts to mitigate the impact of climate change on marine ecosystems include reducing greenhouse gas emissions, protecting and restoring marine habitats, and promoting sustainable fishing practices. It is essential for global cooperation and policy changes to address these challenges and preserve the health of our oceans.",
