Lush green foliage blanketing millions of square kilometers absorbs vast amounts of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, during photosynthesis. This process helps mitigate climate change by preventing excessive heat from escaping back into space.  However, deforestation, driven by factors like logging and agricultural expansion, disrupts this delicate balance.
